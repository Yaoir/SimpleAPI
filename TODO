Testing
	Implement a test script for regression testing, using the command-line interface.
	This will check the internal operation of the server, including data file I/O.

Optional
--------

Performance Optimization
	For the _current_ operation, there is no need to write to the data file.
	Just read the file, and return the current number in the sequence, and close the file.
	Note: This affects the throughput testing, requiring the test to mix requests
		to the endpoints, and not simply use current.

Limit log messages
	Do not repeat messages more than N times.

Unit testing can be added.
